# Introduction-to-Metagenomics-Summer-Workshop-2019

Dates & Times:  June 19, 2019-July 15, 2019 

- Mondays and Wednesdays 1:00-2:30
- Room: MSB 2351

Faculty lecturers:  Drs. David Haslam, Nick Ollberding, Liang Niu

Course organizer:  Drs. Alex Thorman, Ardythe Morrow


Course Goals:
In this four-week introductory workshop, participants will learn the basics of metagenomics and the resources available to them on the UC/CCHMC campus. Concepts include rational experimental design, data analysis and interpretation will be covered by local experts with the intention to build the presence of microbiome research in Cincinnati. For those unexperienced in R, initial lectures will cover the basics required for interpretation of metagenomic data. 

By the end of the workshop, participants will learn when to use metagenomics in their work and design rational experiments aimed at elucidating environmental or patient-derived microbial communities. Further, participants should be able to perform a simple analysis of their data and interpret the results. If participants have existing metagenomic data, analysis can be performed as part of the training curriculum. Lastly, participants will network with others on campus performing similar research to develop the community of microbiome-driven research.
